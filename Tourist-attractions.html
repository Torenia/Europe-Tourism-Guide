                                <p>Catalan Architect Antoni Gaudi is remembered for his fantastic creations. La Sagrada
                                    Familia Church is one of his masterpieces. Located in Barcelona, the unfinished
                                    Catholic
                                    Church can be seen from any high point. Although the temple is still under
                                    construction,
                                    the majestic structure is marvellous to look at. Students of architecture and
                                    history
                                    visit La Sagrada Familia Church to study the history and structure.</p>

                                <p>It is one of the most famous landmarks in Barcelona. Travelers, who wish to see
                                    Gaudi’s
                                    architectural work, must visit the Cathedral. The construction started in 1882 and
                                    Diocese Francisco del Villar was the first architect, who started with the Gothic
                                    style
                                    design. Antoni Gaudi took over and he worked on designing the church till his death.
                                    He
                                    died in the year 1926 and the Church has been under construction for over a century.
                                    Gaudi took inspiration from nature and designed the Cathedral. The interior pillars
                                    resemble trees and a turtle and tortoise are holding the pillars. The interiors
                                    shall
                                    mesmerize the visitor because it looks magical from the inside.</p>

                                <p>It is one of the most famous works of Antoni Gaudi and he had predicted that someday,
                                    the city will be known for the Church. Antoni Gaudi is buried in the Cathedral.
                                    Gaudi
                                    may not have visualized that there would be elevators inside but it allows the
                                    visitors
                                    to see the lowest and highest point of the Church. The Cathedral is dedicated to the
                                    Holy Family (Sagrada Familia).</p>

                                <p>The best time to visit the church is from 9 AM to 12 PM. During peak season, it is
                                    hard
                                    to get an entry ticket. Travelers can buy the entry ticket online. It would be wise
                                    to
                                    buy ticket beforehand because you may have to stand in a queue for hours to get the
                                    entry ticket during peak season. La Sagrada Familia Church is not just any other
                                    Church;
                                    it is a work of art.</p>

                                <p>Arc De Triomphe has been one of the most famous monuments and landmark of tourist
                                    attraction in Paris that stands right at the centre of the Place Charles de Gaulle
                                    also called as the “Place de l’Étoile“. Situated on the western side of the famous
                                    Champs-Élysées, the arc is a part of L’Axe historique, a series of grand monuments
                                    and gracious boulevards extending from Louvre Palace to the exterior of the
                                    city.</p>
                                <p>Arc de Triomphe was ordered to be constructed by the then emperor of France,
                                    Napoleon in 1806 as a tribute to his Grand Armée brave hearts who lost their lives
                                    in the Napoleonic war. Napoleon was inspired by the Roman Arch of Titus and wanted
                                    to build his 19th century version of the monument. The monument was built between
                                    1806 and 1836. In 1810, Napoleon had entered Paris from under a huge wooden model of
                                    the anticipated future arc with his new wife Marie-Louise.</p>

                                <p>The construction of the arc was stopped after Napoleon’s defeat in 1814, but resumed
                                    during the reign of King Louis-Philippe from 1826. Napoleon did not see the complete
                                    structure that was inaugurated in 1836. However, his body was brought from Saint
                                    Helena to Paris from under the arc in 1840 for the final rites to his resting place
                                    in Les Invalides. The arc has seen both victory marches as well as defeats. After
                                    the end of the World War I, Charles Godefroy flew his fighter plane through the Arc
                                    de Triomphe as a tribute to the soldiers killed in the war. It saw marches of
                                    Germans in 1871 (Franco-Prussian War) and Nazis (World War II). The arc also
                                    witnessed two unsuccessful assassinations against Charles De Gaulle and Jacques
                                    Chirac, who survived.</p>

                                    Maurice de Sully ordered demolition of the Paris cathedral, Saint-Étienne (St

                                    calling it unworthy. On its place, the foundation stone of Notre Dame de Paris was

                                    either by Sully or Pope Alexander III in 1163. The high altar was later consecrated

                                    1189. While sections like the western façade and the choir were ready by 1250,

                                    like chapels, porches and various individual embellishments were incorporated during
